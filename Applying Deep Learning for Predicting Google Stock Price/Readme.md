In this project, recurrent neural network (RNN) deep learning method is applied to the daily time series data of opening google stock prices between January 2012 and December 2016 to predict the prices for January 2017.The type of RNN model
used for this project long-short term memory (LSTM) with window size of 60 days.  The dataset used here is obtained from "Deep Learning A-Z 2023: Neural Networks, AI & ChatGPT Prize" course. The model performance is evaluated by measuring 
root mean square error(RMSE) for the month of January 2017. The model is able to predict the prices with high accuracy
